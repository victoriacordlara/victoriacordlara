### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About Me:

My name is Victoria Cordovez. I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. I majored in Statistics with an emphasis on Business and Data Science. Currently, I am looking for new opportunities as an analyst that will challenge me and help me grow as a professional.

With experience in risk, financial accounting, data analytics, leadership, and statistics, I possess both the skills and the drive to excel within any data-driven field.

If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to contact me at victoriaecordovez@gmail.com
