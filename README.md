### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About Me:

I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. I majored in Statistics with an emphasis on Business and Data Science. Currently, I am looking for new opportunities as an analyst that will challenge me and help me grow as a professional.

With experience in risk, accounting, data analytics, leadership, and statistics, I possess both the skills and the drive to excel within any data-driven field.
